                <a href=https://blackclover.fandom.com/wiki/Yami_Sukehiro target="_blank">Yami Sukehiro</a>-
                The rough and boorish leader of the Black Bulls who always inspires his team to do
                their best and beyond.

                Despite her status as a royal, Mimosa is a ray of sunshine and views everyone equally. Well, everyone but Asta,
                who she seems to have a crush on, and her brother, who she hates.

                <a href="https://blackclover.fandom.com/wiki/Julius_Novachrono" target="_blank">Julius Novachrono</a>-
                The 28th Wizard King and beloved by the people, even moreso than the actual king, Julius seeks
                to make the Clover Kingdom a place where status doesn't matter and all are viewed as equals. He is
                also a huge magic nerd.
            </li>
            <li id="asta">
                <a href="https://blackclover.fandom.com/wiki/Asta" target="_blank">Asta</a>-
                The magicless muscle-head that never gives up. When his back is to the wall, he surpasses his limits and
                gets the job done. Although he is very loud, oblivious, and sometimes downright moronic.

                The GOAT!!! This food loving lady with magic as powerful as her appetite could rule the world if she chooses.
                But she would rather spend her time making delicious food for her friends and fawning over her food saving prince,
                Yuno.
