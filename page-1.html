                    <p> In a world where magic and status are everything, <span>Yuno</span> and <span>Asta</span> aim to become one of the most
                        influential
                        figures in the country known as the Wizard King. However, the odds are stacked against them as
                        not
                        only are they peasants, but Asta can't even use magic. that being said, he did work out and
                        train
                        his
                        body to
                        the extreme everyday to make up for it. When it is time for the pair to receive their grimoires,
                        the
                        source of every wizards power, Yuno shocks everyone by receiving a rare grimoire with a four
                        leaf
                        clover
                        rather than the typical three leaf.
                        Asta, on the other hand, doesn't even receive a grimoire.

                <div id="s1BodyTextB">
                    <p> But when Yuno is attacked by someone jealous that he got a four leaf, Asta
                        steps in to save his childhood friend. As expected, even with Asta's stength, he was no match
                        for
                        the
                        wizard he was up against. As the wizard
                        talked down on Asta for having no magic, Yuno came to his defense reminding Asta that his magic
                        was
                        "never giving up". With his childhood friend and rival's
                        encouragement, a black grimoire with a five leaf clover appears before Asta. A black sword comes
                        out
                        of
                        it that Asta can only wield
                        because of his intense training. It has the ability to cut through and nullify magic and he uses
                        it
                        to
                        beat the bad guy and free
                        Yuno.

                        After receiving their grimoires, the pair set out to the capital of the Clover Kingdom to
                        try and take the first step to becoming the Wizard King, joining a Magic Knight squad. The
                        trials set to test the potential recruits were a breeze for Yuno who was always a talented
                        wizard,
                        but Asta struggled to accomplish any of the tasks. By the end, the only task Asta had
                        successfully
                        completed was the combat trial where not only Asta's rare anti-magic sword gave him an
                        advantage,
                        but his opponent also underestimated him. When it came time for the squad captains to choose who
                        they
                        wanted for their teams, Yuno was selected by all of them before ultimately choosing to join the
                        top
                        team,
                        the Golden Dawn. Asta, however, wasn't selected by any of them. Until Yami Sukehiro, leader of
                        the
                        notoriously
                        bad Black Bulls, accepts him into the squad. Thus Asta's journey to becoming the Wizard King
                        begins!

                    Black Clover takes place in the Clover Kingdom. Surrounding the Clover Kingdom
                    are the Spade, Heart, and Club kingdoms. While not much is known about the Club Kingdom,
                    the Heart Kingdom is in tune with natural magic and the Diamond Kingdom is a militaristic
                    kingdom where conquest is everything. The Clover Kingdom is rife with class discrimination
                    and discrimination against those with low level magic. Within the Clover Kingdom, it is said
                    that in the three leaves lie faith, hope, and love. In a fourth leaf like Yuno's, lies luck. In a
                    fifth
                    like Asta's, lies a demon.

                    Black Clover has many things that I enjoy. Magic, comedy, but most importantly,
                    great characters. When I'm not laughing at Asta's single-minded pursuit of a nun he can't
                    actually marry because of her oaths or cheering him on due to his determination, I'm taken
                    in by the other members of the Black Bulls. Gordon looks creepy and mumbles hwen he speaks
                    but just wants to be friends with everyone. Charmy's ravenous appetite is in stark contrast
                    to her miniature size and has a wonderfully mascotish personality. All of the characters, especially
                    in the Black Bulls, are quirky and seem like the kind of people that you would wanna hang with in
                    the real world.
